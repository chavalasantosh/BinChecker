# BinChecker

Description:

BIN Information Retriever
This script is designed to fetch and store Bank Identification Number (BIN) details by querying a specified range of BINs from a web service. The information is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

Features:
Range Specification: Define a custom range of BINs you wish to search.

Concurrency: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient retrieval of BIN data using multithreading.

External Service: Fetches BIN data from https://bin-info.herokuapp.com/.

Automated Storage: Continuously saves fetched data to retrieved_bins.csv in chunks, minimizing data loss in case of interruptions.

How to Use:
Specify your desired range of BINs in the start_bin and end_bin variables.
Execute the script. It will automatically query the BINs and store the valid results to a CSV file.
Notes:
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to query and store BIN information.
The service at https://bin-info.herokuapp.com/ might have request limits or other constraints, so be aware of any potential rate limits or terms of use.
Disclaimer: Make sure you have the right to fetch and store data from third-party services. Ensure that your usage complies with the terms of service of the data provider and any applicable laws.
